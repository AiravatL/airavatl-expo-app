  # Add Cancel Bid Feature for Drivers

  1. New Functions
    - `cancel_bid` - Function to cancel a driver's bid on an active auction
    - Proper validation and notification handling

  2. Security
    - Only drivers can cancel their own bids
    - Only bids on active auctions can be cancelled
    - Proper audit logging
