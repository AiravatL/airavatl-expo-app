  # Enhanced Auction System Implementation

  1. New Tables
    - `auction_audit_logs` - For tracking all auction activity
    - `auction_notifications` - For managing user notifications
    - `auction_bid_history` - For maintaining bid history

  2. Changes
    - Add validation constraints to auction_bids
    - Add notification triggers
    - Add audit logging
    - Enhance auction closure logic
