Thanks for helping improve the app ðŸšš.  
Below are the ground rules so every branch, commit and pull-request looks familiar to reviewers.

## Branch model

| Branch           | Role                                          | Merge into    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `main`           | Production releases (EAS build âžœ Google Play) | â€”             |
| `dev`            | Ongoing integration                           | `main` via PR |
| `feature/<name>` | Short-lived feature / fix work                | `dev` via PR  |

_Never_ push directly to `main`.
